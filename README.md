# Getting started

This repo contains a notebook for extracting secondary structure information from alpha fold proteins that have an average confidence score of > 0.9.

# Cheat sheet of secondary structure information:
  -----------------------------------------------
    H = α-helix
    B = residue in isolated β-bridge
    E = extended strand, participates in β ladder
    G = 3-helix (310 helix)
    I = 5 helix (π-helix)
    T = hydrogen bonded turn
    S = bend
