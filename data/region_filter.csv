ARM-like and Heat-like helical repeats
Leucine-zipper 2
Basic (repression of DNA-binding)
DNA-binding; major groove
SS DNA-binding
Required for the formation of higher order complexes of ZBED1 with consensus DNA binding sequences
Alpha-helical region with structural similarity to HEAT repeats
Required for DNA-binding and interaction with NFKBIA
Interaction with CARM1
Mediates dimerization, DNA-binding, transcription repression of CCNA2 and interaction with HMGA2
Core promoter DNA-binding
Required for DNA binding
DNA-binding; may bind double-stranded DNA
Helical region with structural similarity to ARM repeat domains
No DNA binding activity or transactivation activity, but complete prevention of TRAF-dependent NF-Kappa-B activation; associates with TRAF2 and JUN
Involved in DNA binding
DNA-binding; preference for heteroduplex DNA
Leucine-zipper
Required for activation of histone H4 transcription and contributes to DNA-binding
Mediates promoter DNA-binding and activation of transcription
Required for both high-affinity DNA binding and pericentromeric heterochromatin localization
DNA-binding; preference for single stranded DNA; required for formation of stable nucleoprotein complex
DNA-binding domain
DNA-binding; may bind to the undamaged single-strand DNA of the DNA repair bubble
Interaction with ARMC12
3' overhang DNA-binding
DNA-binding; H2TH (helix-2turn-helix) motif which binds double-stranded DNA
Required for DNA-binding and transcriptional repression
Involved in ssDNA binding
Involved in DNA-binding
DNA-binding regulation
DNA-binding
Critical for glycosaminoglycan, lipid A, lysozyme and DNA binding
Contributes to single strand DNA binding activity
DNA-binding; minor groove
Leucine-zipper 1
Leucine-zipper 3
Required for DNA-binding
DNA-binding (with the preference D loop > dsDNA > ssDNA)
